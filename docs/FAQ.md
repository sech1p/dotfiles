* You have three monitors, are you okay with multiple screens with the GTX 1050 Ti and NVidia's proprietary drivers?

Yes, it's working decent. Sometimes I got minor bugs but they are not annoying much.

* Is KDE 6 still buggy?

Last time it's less buggy than earlier. KDE developers fixed many issues, it's pretty usable.

BTW: KDE 6 is (as of January 2025) fresh and only a few months old.

* Are you planning to distrohopping/change desktop environment?

Not for now, I feel good with Arch right now.

For now I'm giving KDE 6 a chance as it's a fresh version of KDE, when I use Linux a bit more I'm thinking about changing the environment to [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org).
