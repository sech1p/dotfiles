# ⚠️ Important

This repo is no longer updated, due migration to Windows 11 caused by fatal Arch Linux update - which broken the whole distribution, making it unsuable.

Actually, I use some of my dotfiles legacy in Windows Subsystem for Linux and Windows itself. (e.g. Visual Studio Code extensions, and .zshrc)

Dotfiles of my setups

## ⚠️ Notice

File `.zshrc` references to my `$HOME` directory (as absolute paths). Before you starting using my dotfiles, change all reference of my username (sech1p) to name of your username in your environment.

I plan to change this absolute paths as soon as possible. Sorry for inconveniences!
